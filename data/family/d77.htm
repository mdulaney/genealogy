signs for the very first time.  They renamed the road that was called Dulaney
Rd. to White Rock Road. The people in the county called the road &quot;Dulaney
Road&quot; because it was populated with Dulaney families and families that were
married into the Dulaney families.  It is now called White Rock Road due to the
church partly built on a large white rock.  It has been said that the reason
for the road to have road signs is due to the fact that no longer did the ambulance
drivers know the locations of the unnamed streets.  He was also known as Dulany
